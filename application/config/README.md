This directory is meant to help for the grading of this project.

There is an SQL data dump located here, `csc317db.sql` which is used to populate the test database for this.

This dump contains both the structure and the data of an example database.

# DATABASE DETAILS
This app assumes the following (from `models/database.js`):

Database name: csc317db

Database user: photoapp

Database password:

NOTE: the photoapp user was only tested while having FULL privileges in the database.

## DATABASE TESTING
The data dump adds users, the following is a user that can be logged into for testing:

email: erick@gmail.com

Password: P@ssword1

Or register a user if that doesnt work! (:
